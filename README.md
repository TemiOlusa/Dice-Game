# ðŸŽ² Dice Game (Python)

A simple Python console game that simulates rolling dice.  
You can choose to roll **1 die** or **2 dice**, and the program will display the result.  


## Features
- Roll either **one** or **two** dice.  
- Randomized results between `1 - 6`.  
- Input validation with clear error messages.  
- Option to **re-roll** or **exit** after each game.  


## Requirements
- Python 3 (recommended: Python 3.8 or higher)  


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TemiOlusa/Dice-Game.git
   ```


## Example Gameplay
```bash
Would you like to roll 1 or 2 dice: 2
Dice 1 landed on 3
Dice 2 landed on 6

Would you like to roll again? (yes/no): yes
Rebooting...
```


## Future Improvements
- Add a simple GUI version (Tkinter or PyQt).  
- Allow rolling more than 2 dice.  
- Add scoring or a multiplayer mode.
